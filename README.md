Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
============
Quick overview of the assignment and file type description.

- This dataset is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was originally made avaiable here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
- Data is unzipped into working directory
- Script run_analysis.R is created and is later executed in same working directory to obtain the tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Files type description

- run_analysis.R: cleaning script that does the following

Step 1: "Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set."
Step 2: "Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement."
Step 3: "Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set."
Step 4: "Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names."
Step 5: "Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."
